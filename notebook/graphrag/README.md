# Graph RAG Patterns in Amazon Neptune
This repository provids code samples that accompany presentations on Generative AI with Amazon Neptune. 

In those presentations, we describe why Knowledge Graph improves Generative AI. We argue that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves responses to questions that a user asks in a generative AI application. RAG hits your enterprise database to provide the large language model (LLM) current, accurate, relevant context to answer the question. A graph database provides such context. Furthermore, because a graph navigates relationships, it can pull in additional context that explains and elaborates the result. 


We demonstrate three Graph RAG patterns.
